# GenDES

GenDES allows to easily, accurately and efficiently simulate any kind of event based phenomenon.

A full Game Boy emulator has been done and can be found in the [release](https://github.com/thenesis-org/gendes/releases) section.

GenDES provides generic debugging features which can be useful for game developpers and the emulation ecosystem.
