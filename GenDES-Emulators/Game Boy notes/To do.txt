*Add more listeners for hardware events.
*Move sub-devices in separate classes (internal classes of GameBoy).
*Implement State save/restore.
*Implement cheat searcher.
*Implement access breakpoints.
*Implement access map.
*Audio:
-Audio channel 1 lacks something (but it's not important). For example, in Super Mario Land, at the end of a
 level, the sound while counting remaining time is continuous whereas it should not: the sound is emitted
 every 2 timer interrupts (timer is set at 64 Hz initially but increase to ?? Hz when the time counter goes below 100,
 and to ?? Hz when the time counter goes below 50).
-Emulation tends to be slighty faster than sound playing. This leads to periodic blocking of emulation.
 We must find a way to keep sound synchronized with emulation.
 This can be done by audio frequency adjustement rather than emulation speed adjustement.
-Implement desactivation of channels individually.
*Video:
-Implement sprite priority for the original game boy mode.
-Implement Sub-scanline modification of video registers.
-Implement Tiles, maps and sprites dump.
-Implemebt HDMA started by software.
*Implement serial.
*Implement infrared.
*Implement MBC7 and MBC3.

*!There is a race condition when running the emulator before powering on the Game Boy. In this case, the clock event is added
 !before the current time leading to a nearly infinite loop.
