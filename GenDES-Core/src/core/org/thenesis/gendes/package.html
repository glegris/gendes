Contains the main emulation classes and some common utilities.
<p>
The class <code>EmulationSystem</code> manages the emulation.
It controls the device tree, schedules all events and allows you to run emulation for a given amount of time.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>EmulationDevice</code> represents a device that can run in an <code>EmulationSystem</code>.
It must belong to an <code>EmulationSystem</code> to work.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>EmulationEvent</code> specifies an event that can occur inside a given device.
Events are dispatched by the <code>EmulationSystem</code> which the device belongs to.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>EmulationClock</code> represents a special device representing a clock.
Events can be attached to an <code>EmulationClock</code> instead of a <code>EmulationSystem</code> for cycle accurate emulation and easy management.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>EmulationThread</code> allows to run an <code>EmulationSystem</code> in a separate thread.
It allows also to control the speed of emulation and gives performance informations. 
</p>
<p>
The class <code>EmulationTimer</code> provides a time base for the <code>EmulationThread</code>.
The class <code>SystemMillisecondTimer</code> is a subclass of <code>EmulationTimer</code> which uses the method <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>.
This is generally the class you will use but you can also implements a more accurate timer.
Note that if you implement your own <code>EmulationTimer</code>, you should not use the method <code>System.nanoTime()</code> under Windows: it is very slow, eating a lot of CPU with just a few calls and causing jerky emulation.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>EmulationState</code> contains the state of an <code>EmulationSystem</code>.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>TimeStamp</code> is used to represents a given time during emulation. 
</p>
<p>
The class <code>FastString</code> is used to quickly build strings. It is mainly used for debugging. 
</p>
<p>
The class <code>Tools</code> contains some simple common tools.
</p>
